# NetherRoofLimiter
A lightweight Minecraft plugin to limit travel on the Nether roof while still allowing for farms

PLEASE CHECK RELEASES FOR THE SOURCE CODE IF NEEDED! The jar file can be found there as well

This spigot/paper plugin makes it so when you enter the nether roof, your movement is restricted to 64 blocks in each direction (ignoring Y axis)
I made this as an alternative to disabling the nether roof, so players can still build farms but not be able to travel long distances. Great for anarchy servers or SMP
I have tested bugs and exploits and made sure to your entry point is reset when leaving the roof in every possible way. If you still find any bugs please report them and ill try to update ASAP

As of right now, the entry point for the roof is reset if the server restarts. It will be kept if a player leaves the game. Just an FYI that players shouldnt log out on the Nether roof unless they have a hole or portal near to get out.

Tested In 1.20-1.21.4, I can't confirm any other versions so you will just have to test it but it should work fine.
